# EdgeFlow_matlab

Code used to generate the results in the paper: 
Kimberly McGuire, Guido de Croon, Karl Tuyls and Hilbert Kappen,  "Efficient Optical flow and Stereo Vision for Velocity Estimation and
Obstacle Avoidance on an Autonomous Pocket Drone", Submitted to Robotics and Automation Letters (2016)

Before you start:

The code is developed for Matlab 2016a (the newest computervision library)

To start up the code, run Edgeflow_generate_results.m.

To find the images it used to run on, clone the following repository to your computer: git@github.com:knmcguire/stereo_images_database.git
